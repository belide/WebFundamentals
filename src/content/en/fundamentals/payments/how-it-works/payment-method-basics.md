## Payment Methods

The Payment Request API makes it easy for a browser to pass payment credentials, such as credit card details, to a merchant. The API can also accept payments through apps that process payments in nearly any way they wish: e-money, bank transfers, bitcoin, etc.

In the Payment Request API, _payment methods_ are processes that can be invoked to process a payment, and can be thought of somewhat like "plugins" for the Payment Request API. Each payment method consists of a required payment method identifier and an optional detail parameter.

In the following example we declare two payment methods: one that can process Visa, Mastercard, and JCB cards via basic-card; and an Android app called BobPay built to integrate with the Payment Request API, via the URL https://bobpay.xyz/pay.

```javascript
const methodData = [{ 
 supportedMethods: 'basic-card', 
 data: { 
   supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'master', 'jcb'] 
 } 
}, { 
 supportedMethods: 'https://bobpay.xyz/pay' 
}];
```

When the Payment Request UI is displayed to a customer during checkout, they see a subset of the payment methods specified by the merchant. The subset displayed to the user consists of all the payment methods available to the user on this device. The customer can select one of the methods to use for payment, as shown here.

## Standardized vs. URL-based Payment Methods

There are two types of payment method identifiers: *standardized* and *URL-based*.

### Standardized

Standardized payment methods are those that are literally standardized in their respective W3C specifications, meaning that all parameters required to fill the `data` property are defined in the specs.

You may already be familiar with [the basic-card method](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-method-basic-card/). At this time, August 2018, it is the only officially-standardized payment method, and is supported by most browsers that implement the Payment Request API. However, because it returns raw, untokenized card information, it is safe to say that `basic-card` is not the future of web payments.

There is a [registry of standardized payment methods](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-id/#registry) in the spec, but there are other standardization candidates under active discussion. 

*   [Basic Credit Transfer Payment](http://w3c.github.io/webpayments-methods-credit-transfer-direct-debit/) (basic-credit-transfer): A payment method to transfer money between bank accounts.
*   [Tokenized Card Payment](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/interledger-payment-method.html) (tokenized-card): A payment method that provides a token representing a card instead of a raw card number.
*   [Interledger Payment Method](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/interledger-payment-method.html) (interledger): A payment method that transfers money using [the interledger protocol](https://interledger.org/).
*   [Basic SEPAmail Payment](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/sepamail) (sepamail): A payment method that supports payment by SEPAmail Applications such as RUBIS, GEMME, or JADE.

In the example below, basic-card is specified as the `supportedMethods` value and requires that the `data` value be supplied, containing a list of the supported card providers and card types.

```javascript
supportedMethods: 'basic-card',
data: {
  supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'master', 'jcb'],
  supportedTypes: ['credit', 'debit', 'prepaid']
}
```

### URL-based

URL-based payment methods are those that anyone can define independently, without reliance on W3C standardization. Proprietary payment methods such as Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay are good examples. These payment methods are specified using a unique URL identifier such as https://google.com/pay or https://www.alipay.com/webpay. 

The URLs represent a payment method and are usually associated with a particular payment app, but it is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship. It's possible for one payment method to be supported by multiple payment apps, or for one payment app to support multiple payment methods. 

For example, a third-party payment app might support both the basic-card method as well as a specific https://bobpay.xyz method. 

Unlike standardized payment methods, URL-based payment methods have no registry. Anyone can develop and provide their own payment apps that support a payment method. This allows the Web Payments concept to inherently scale into quite a large payment ecosystem. 

In the example below, Google Pay is invoked via its URL; any information to be passed to the payment method can be supplied in the optional `data` value.

```javascript
supportedMethods: 'https://google.com/pay',
data: {
  ...
}
```

URL-based payment methods other than Google Pay include Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. If you want to learn more about them, including their `data` property details, check out the links below.
