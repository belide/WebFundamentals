# How the payment ecosystem works {: .page-title }

( Video embed? )

Let's see how the new payment ecosystem looks from the developer's point of view.

## The APIs

Web Payments comprises multiple emerging web standards. The Payment Request API and the Payment Handler API are the most important APIs.

*   **Payment Request API:** With the [Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/), users can check out with just a few taps. The browser removes the need for users to enter shipping and payment information by storing it and providing it for checkouts. This removes the friction of going through a lengthy and difficult purchase flow and can result in higher conversion for merchants.
*   **Payment Handler API:** The [Payment Handler API](https://w3c.github.io/payment-handler/) opens up the ecosystem to payment providers by allowing their web-based payment applications to act as payment methods on merchant websites through the standard Payment Request API. In addition, there are several related specifications that make up Web Payments.
*   [Payment Method Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-id/)
    *   [Payment Method: Basic Card](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-basic-card/)
        *   [Card Network Identifiers Approved for use with Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/Payments/card-network-ids)
    *   [Credit Transfer Payment](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-credit-transfer/)
    *   [Interledger Payment Method](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/interledger/) (unofficial)
    *   [Tokenized Card Payment](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-methods-tokenization/index.html) (unofficial)
*   [3-D Secure 2 with Payment Request API](https://w3c.github.io/3ds/) (unofficial)
*   [Payment Method Manifest](https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-manifest/)

## The Players

There are typically four participants in an online transaction.

## How the Payment Request Process Works

The typical sequence of events in processing a credit card payment on the web looks like this:

1.  The Customer visits merchant's website, adds items to a shopping cart, and starts the checkout flow.
1.  The Merchant needs the customer's payment credentials to process the transaction. They present a payment request UI to the customer using **the Payment Request API**. The UI lists various methods of payment including credit card numbers saved in Autofill, third party payment apps like Google Pay, Samsung Pay, etc. The Merchant can optionally request the customer's shipping address and contact information.
1.  If the customer chooses an installed payment app like Google Pay, Chrome launches the app which might allow the customer to choose a card to pay with using **the Payment Handler API**. This step is completely up to the payment handler's implementation. In this example, if the customer authorizes the payment, Google Pay returns a token (payment credential) to the Payment Request API, which relays it to the merchant site.
1.  The merchant site sends the payment credential to a PSP to process the payment and initiate funds transfer. Usually, verifying the payment on the server side is also required.
1.  The PSP processes the payment, securely requesting a funds transfer from the customer's bank or credit card issuer to the merchant, and then returns a success or failure result to the merchant website.
1.  The merchant website notifies the customer of the success or failure of the transaction and displays next steps, e.g., shipping the purchased item.

## PSP Reliance

If you are a merchant and want to accept credit card payments, PSPs are an important link in the payment processing chain. Implementing Web Payments does not obviate the need for a PSP.

Merchants usually rely on a third-party PSP to perform payment processing for convenience and expense reasons. This is primarily because most PSPs maintain compliance with [PCI DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard), an information security standard that regulates the safety of cardholder data.

Because achieving and maintaining strict PCI DSS compliance is expensive and difficult, most merchants find that relying on a compliant PSP avoids going through the certification process themselves. Some large and financially robust companies, however, obtain their own PCI DSS certification specifically to avoid such third-party reliance.

Thus, delegating payment processing to a PCI DSS-compliant PSP both simplifies the merchant site's payment processing requirements and ensures payment information integrity for the customer.

Ask your PSP if you can use the Payment Request API through their SDK; if not, you can ask them to add support for it.
